Product information management

## Introduction

## Basic information
This program was written for my girlfriend to store data about bought and sold products. Daily reports from shop cash register are uploaded to system by registered user and parsed to be stored in MySQL data base. Invoices are input manualy by forms due to the lack of possibility to parse them. The whole point for this project is to create quick raports about daily nett income, product availability and quick acces to all invoices.
